# my-website

This repository now contains a static build of the "Water Mission Game" site that was previously hosted on Replit.

## Viewing the site on GitHub Pages

1. Ensure the **GitHub Pages** source is set to the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder in the repository settings.
2. After a minute or two, the site will be available at:
   `https://akeirahlandry55-collab.github.io/my-website/`

The `index.html` file and `assets/` directory hold the complete client-side code.

You can edit or replace these files to update the site, or add original source files (e.g. React project) if you prefer to maintain the project with a build step.
